#### Tuesday Weekly Practice

##### 7:00PM. 

The core of our practice is traditional Zen meditation, which is silent and unguided. <span class='marginnote'>See [How to Sit Zazen](http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/about-zen/how-to-sit-zazen/) by the Dogen Sangha Los Angeles and also [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/howtosit/)  prepared by our sangha member, Lauren Jurgensen.</span> We meditate for two short periods of zazen (seated meditation) and one of kinhin (walking meditation). This is followed by a short discussion where we  talk about the practical aspects of meditation.  Beginners are welcome and basic instruction in meditation will be given at the beginning of the session.

We have a few meditation cushions you can use as well as a few chairs. If you have your a favorite meditation cushion, chair or bench, please consider bringing it.
