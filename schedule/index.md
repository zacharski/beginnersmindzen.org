This is across the street from Carl's Ice Cream. There is an elevator in the building. We are on the third floor.

#### Tuesday Weekly Practice

##### 7:00PM. 

The core of our practice is traditional Zen meditation, which is silent and unguided. <span class='marginnote'>See [How to Sit Zazen](http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/about-zen/how-to-sit-zazen/) by the Dogen Sangha Los Angeles and also [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/howtosit/)  prepared by our sangha member, Lauren Jurgensen.</span> We meditate for two short periods of zazen (seated meditation) and one of kinhin (walking meditation). This is followed by a short discussion where we  talk about the practical aspects of meditation.  Beginners are welcome and basic instruction in meditation will be given at the beginning of the session.

We have a few meditation cushions you can use as well as a few chairs. If you have your a favorite meditation cushion, chair or bench, please consider bringing it.

#### Sunday Formal Zen Service

##### September 11, 2pm
This will be an *annotated* Zen Buddhist services which include chanting, meditation, and a short dharma discussion. By *annotated* we mean that periodically we will stop the service to explain the significance of what we are doing ([meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/)).

#### Sunday Zen 101 Book Study

##### TBD
The next book we will be discussing is  <span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/jerk2.png"> </span>[*Don't Be a Jerk: And Other Practical Advice from Dogen, Japan's Greatest Zen Master*](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Be-Jerk-Practical-Greatest/dp/1608683885/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472264377&sr=8-1&keywords=don%27t+be+a+jerk) by Brad Warner. Stay tuned for more information. We should be starting the group shortly.

From the book's description:

> The Shobogenzo (The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye) is a revered eight-hundred-year-old Zen Buddhism classic written by the Japanese monk Eihei Dogen. Despite the timeless wisdom of his teachings, many consider the book difficult to understand and daunting to read. In Don’t Be a Jerk, Zen priest and bestselling author Brad Warner, through accessible paraphrasing and incisive commentary, applies Dogen’s teachings to modern times. While entertaining and sometimes irreverent, Warner is also an astute scholar who sees in Dogen very modern psychological concepts, as well as insights on such topics as feminism and reincarnation. Warner even shows that Dogen offered a “Middle Way” in the currently raging debate between science and religion. For curious readers worried that Dogen’s teachings are too philosophically opaque, Don’t Be a Jerk is hilarious, understandable, and wise.
