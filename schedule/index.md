This is across the street from Carl's Ice Cream. There is an elevator in the building. We are on the third floor.

#### Tuesday Weekly Practice

##### 7:00PM. 

The core of our practice is traditional Zen meditation, which is silent and unguided. <span class='marginnote'>See [How to Sit Zazen](http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/about-zen/how-to-sit-zazen/) by the Dogen Sangha Los Angeles and also [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/howtosit/)  prepared by our sangha member, Lauren Jurgensen.</span> We meditate for two short periods of zazen (seated meditation) and one of kinhin (walking meditation). This is followed by a short discussion where we  talk about the practical aspects of meditation.  Beginners are welcome and basic instruction in meditation will be given at the beginning of the session.

We have a few meditation cushions you can use as well as a few chairs. If you have your a favorite meditation cushion, chair or bench, please consider bringing it.

#### Sunday Zen 101 Book Study

##### Salem Church Library 1pm
Regardless of which book we are discussing, the goal of the group is to support each other as we navigate our lives. 

The current book we are discussing is  <span class='marginnote'><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/fallApart.jpg"> </span>[*When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times*](https://www.amazon.com/When-Things-Fall-Apart-Anniversary/dp/1611803438/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1485865479&sr=8-1&keywords=pema+chodron) by Pema Chodron. Check our [Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/) to see where we currently are in the book.

From the book's description:

> How can we live our lives when everything seems to fall apart—when we are continually overcome by fear, anxiety, and pain? The answer, Pema Chödrön suggests, might be just the opposite of what you expect. Here, in her most beloved and acclaimed work, Pema shows that moving toward painful situations and becoming intimate with them can open up our hearts in ways we never before imagined. Drawing from traditional Buddhist wisdom, she offers life-changing tools for transforming suffering and negative patterns into habitual ease and boundless joy.
