    <p>We invite beginners and experienced practitioners alike. All events are free.</p>

<h4 id="tuesday-weekly-practice">Tuesday Weekly Practice</h4>

<h5 id="pm-location-suite-331-general-washington-executive-center">7:00PM. Location: Suite 331 General Washington Executive Center</h5>

<h5 id="princess-anne-st-fredericksburg-va">217 Princess Anne St., Fredericksburg, VA</h5>

<p>The core of our practice is traditional Zen meditation, which is silent and unguided. <span class="marginnote">See <a href="http://www.dogensanghalosangeles.org/about-zen/how-to-sit-zazen/">How to Sit Zazen</a> by the Dogen Sangha Los Angeles and also <a href="/howtosit/">this page</a>  prepared by our sangha member, Lauren Jurgensen.</span> We meditate for two short periods of zazen (seated meditation) and one of kinhin (walking meditation). This is followed by a short discussion where we  talk about the practical aspects of meditation.  Beginners are welcome and basic instruction in meditation will be given at the beginning of the session.</p>

<p>We practice at the General Washington Executive Center across the street from Carl’s Ice Cream on Princess Anne St. We are on the third floor (there is an elevator) in room 331.</p>

<p>We have a few meditation cushions you can use as well as a few chairs. If you have your a favorite meditation cushion, chair or bench, please consider bringing it.</p>

<p>For current information please see our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/">Meetup Page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="sunday-book-study">Sunday Book Study</h4>

<h5 id="pm-location-salem-church-library-2607-salem-church-rd-fredericksburg">2:00pm. Location: Salem Church Library, 2607 Salem Church Rd, Fredericksburg</h5>
<p>We <span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/img/wherever.png" /> </span> are discussing the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wherever-You-Go-There-Are/dp/1401307787/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465227510&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=wherever+you+go+there+you+are"><em>Wherever You Go There You Are</em></a> by Jon Kabat-Zinn. For current information about the group please see our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/">Meetup Page</a>
From an Amazon customer review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A family member bought this book. I found it sitting on a shelf, glanced at the cover and involuntarily thought to myself “uh oh, granola time,” and came within a heartbeat of dismissing the book out of hand. Luckily, I did not. Instead, I read the introduction, and then found myself – almost in a state of disbelief – reading on and on. I was amazed to find that the book is not just one more new age book muttering away about a world none of us really lives in. To the contrary, the book is written by someone with a profound understanding of everyday reality, who is astonishingly good at sharing that understanding. This is simply a beautiful little book, beautifully written.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This group is led by our sangha member, Trina.</p>

<p>Please consider joining us!</p>

<p>Once we find a location we will be offering regular Zen Buddhist services which include chanting, meditation, and a short dharma discussion. Once this does get organized it will be announced both here and on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Beginners-Mind-Zen/">meetup page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="informal-meetings">Informal meetings</h4>

<h5 id="by-appointment">by appointment</h5>
