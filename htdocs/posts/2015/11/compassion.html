    <blockquote>
  <p><em>Compassion is the ability to see what needs doing right now and the willingness to do it right now</em> - Brad Warner, Zen Priest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is not enough to espouse compassion, you have to act on it to make it real</em> - Dalai Lama.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The whole idea of compassion is based on a keen awareness of the interdependence of all these living beings, which are all part of one another, and all involved in one another</em> - Thomas Merton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all live busy lives. We work at hard jobs often putting in more than 40 hours per week. Then there are all the other tasks that need doing: laundry, shopping, cooking, taking care of our kids or our parents. We unwind by watching a tv show or by surfing the web. Sometimes it seems that if we can live this modern life and just have a bit of happiness, that would be enough. We may be aware of compassion but don’t take time to consciously fit compassionate acts into our lives.</p>

<p>Just this past week I received email from a friend–a Zen priest who was ordained at the same ceremony I was. He said he was quitting his university job in Oregon and moving to Maryland with his wife and kids to live and work in a Catholic Worker intentional community that serves the homeless. That seems like a life focused on helping others. But what about the rest of us who are struggling with living, not in a monastic intentional community, but in modern urban life? Where does compassion and helping others fit in?</p>

<p>I would like to invite you to a discussion on Sunday 15 November at 2pm at Blackstone Coffee, 1113 Jefferson Davis Hwy (look for a ‘Zen’ sign on our table). The topics are 1) how can we be more compassionate in our daily lives and 2) what can we do as a small community to foster compassion. To seed this discussion, I have a few short videos and a few web links.</p>

<p>This first video (surprisingly, an insurance company advertisement) was discovered by Ted Pickett, one of our community members.</p>

<p>This next one is in a similar vein:</p>

<p>This last video is from an organization envisioned by the Dalai Lama called <a href="http://www.joinaforce4good.org/">A Force For Good</a> (There is a variety of information on <a href="http://www.joinaforce4good.org/">their website</a> and a short explanation at <a href="http://www.6seconds.org/2015/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-the-dalai-lamas-vision-for-good/">Daniel Goleman on the Dalai Lama’s Vision for Good</a>)</p>

<p>Bernie Glassman (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsugen_Bernard_Glassman">wikipedia article</a>) authored a number of books about engaged buddhism. He offers three tenets:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> Entering the stream of Socially Engaged Spirituality, I vow to live a life of:
 Not-knowing, thereby giving up fixed ideas about ourselves and the universe
 Bearing witness to the joy and suffering of the world
 Doing Action arising from Not Knowing and Bearing Witness
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There are some interesting short articles <a href="http://zenpeacemakers.org/">here</a>, including <a href="http://zenpeacemakers.org/zen-peacemakers/who-we-are/zen-peacemakers-sangha/dharma-talks/bernie-day-with-bernie/">A Day with Bernie Glassman</a> and <a href="http://zenpeacemakers.org/zen-peacemakers/who-we-are/zen-peacemakers-sangha/dharma-talks/bernie-divinity-lecture-3/">Bearing Witness- A Harvard Divinity School Talk</a> (this last talk mentions a video about him which I could not find on the web).</p>

<p>If you have other videos or links you think relevant to the discussion please post them to <a href="http://compassionatepath.org/forum.html">our forum</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to see you at the discussion!</p>
