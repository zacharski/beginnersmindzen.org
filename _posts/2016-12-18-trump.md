> This is an extraordinary time full of vital, transformative movements that could not be foreseen.  <span class='marginnote'>These quotes are from the book [Hope in the Dark: Untold Histories, Wild Possibilities](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1608465764/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) ([public library](http://www.worldcat.org/title/hope-in-the-dark-untold-histories-wild-possibilities/oclc/54778566&referer=brief_results)) by Rebecca Solnit </span> It is also a nightmarish time. Full engagement requires the ability to perceive both.  The twenty-first century has seen the rise of hideous economic inequality, perhaps due to amnesia both of the working people who countenance declines in wages, working conditions, and social services, and the elites who forgot that they conceded to some of these things in the hope of avoiding revolution. Worse [...] is the arrival of climate change, faster harder, and more devastating than scientists anticipated.

> There are times when it seems as though not only the future but the present is dark: few recognize what a radically transformed world we live in, one that has been transformed not only by such nightmares as global warming and global capital, but by dreams of freedom and of justice — and transformed by things we could not have dreamed of… We need to hope for the realization of our own dreams, but also to recognize a world that will remain wilder than our imaginations.

>The evidence is all around us of tremendous suffering and tremendous destruction.

>Hope doesn't mean denying these realities. It means facing them and addressing them by remembering what else the twenty-first century has brought, including the movements, heroes, and shifts in consciousness that address these things now. 

> It is important to say what hope is not: it is not the belief that everything was, is, or will be fine. The evidence is all around us of tremendous suffering and tremendous destruction. The hope I'm interested in is about broad perspectives with specific possibilities, ones that invite or demand that we act.
